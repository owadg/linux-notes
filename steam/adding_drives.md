# Adding drives
---
## Context
I have a 4TB hard drive that I have just been using for pictures. I got it when I was using Windows, and I wanted to be able to use it in my Windows install as well, so it is formatted as NTFS. I have lots of games but not enough space on my solid state drive, so I thought I would configure steam to use the 4tb drive as a library location.

## Issue
I could download games, but I couldn't run them.

## Research
I tried running steam from the console to get some extra troubleshooting information. I was getting an error that said I did not have file access permissions. A quick Google search revealed to me that this was because I formatted the drive as NTFS

## Resolution
I didn't want to reformat the drive so I just used my SSD.
